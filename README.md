Static Composition #2 (Turing: Mod 1)

**Project Scope**

The aim of this project was to recreate a static composition provided through our instructor with no native files at our disposal. We were to maintain the overall layout, but had creative liberties in terms of copy, images, icons, and color, so long as we made sure to use a complimentary color theme. The challenge required us to make the site responsive as well, with the layout adapting to various screen sizes. However, a responsive layout composition was not provided for us, only a desktop layout, and we were assumed to use our best judgement in regards to responsiveness. The first image below is the original layout, followed by my re-interpritation.

My version is called localCO, a website where you can find local makers in Colorado and see what types of products they offer, as well as what local markets they're attending. All of the basic icons were sourced through free icon websites and the 'localCO' logo was found online and modified in Photoshop to fit within the asthetic scope of the web page. The accent color of the page is North Texas Green, which is the same color used for the *Colorado Company* badge, which is given to local business by the state of Colorado. Additional color compliments on the page are derived from this accent color to make for a more cohesive template.

The web page is built from a card based system, with each card representing a different vendor. As a small business owner myself, all of these businesses are owned by people I either know personally or have worked with in the past. Each card has an image representative of the company, their brand name, location, and what their product specialty is. Though the numbers are randomly assigned, additional values for number of upcoming markets and exclusive offers are also present. 

Responive features of the web page maintain a four card row on larger displays, but maintain the overall aspect ratio of the card on smaller displays and mobile. The console in the header also restructures on smaller displays, making sure no buttons shrink or are illegible.
